Franklin, Day 1
===============

Franklin Hale pinched his thumb and forefinger at the bridge of his nose, rubbing a spot that should have been numb from the weight of his glasses.  The sensation should have been tingly, pleasant, and comforting.

Franklin hadn't worn prescription eyewear in the year since he'd gotten his eyes fixed, but he still had the habits.  He still pinched at his nose and rubbed his temples.  He still brushed his straight, scraggy brown hair back behind his ears, tucking it behind plastic arms that weren't there.  He still startled himself awake some nights with an unfulfillable driving need to walk to the bathroom, grope around for the saline bottle, and take out his contacts.

He knew pinching his nose wasn't eliciting the effect he wanted, that release of accumulated tension that somehow linked two dime-sized patches of skin to all of his shoulder and back muscles.  He knew it wasn't working, but the motion had been practiced over two decades with glasses.  A single year hadn't been long enough to make a dent in the muscle memory.  The pinch was here to stay.

He knew all of these things but he didn't care in the slightest.

His eyes shifted focus from the computer screen to the desk around it.  They found energy drink cans, emptied hours and days ago, glazed ceramic plates that appeared clean but when concentrated on revealed the fruits and vegetables that had been ferried upon them from the kitchen, and the keyboard that sat inert in front of the screen.  His laptop hung in a sling beneath one side of the desk, cables growing from one edge and snaking to binder clips attached above the sling.

He reached for the cables and stopped himself.  His other hand reached for the bright red trackball next to his keyboard and spun it.  Two clicks later and the screen went dark as he sensed the few remaining moving parts in the laptop spin down.  The cables were plucked clear of their ports, left to dangle from the binder clips, and the laptop from its hammock, jammed with tender force into a messenger bag on the floor below it.

The smiles between Franklin and the barista behind the counter were warm and genuine.  She spoke first.

"Medium coffee, black?"

Franklin nodded, the smile widening to improbable lengths.  "Exactly.  How are you today, Addy?"

The young lady's name tag read _Ariadne_ in handwritten curls and swooshes, but she and Franklin had long ago introduced themselves.  Her hands worked without thought to grab a paper cup and marker as they continued to make small talk.

"Glad to be in here where it's warm."  Her eyes and head tipped to the side to indicate another barista working the drive-through window, bundled, capped, and mittened.

Franklin's smile turned up into a brief smirk.  He scanned the room around him and saw that most of the chairs and sofas were occupied with people clutching cups of steaming liquid or hunched over laptops and tablets.

One of Addy's hands had worked the cash register to ring in the order resulting in a fresh of green LED light with a total just below Franklin's eye level.  Cash already in hand, he gave it to her and followed it with a small wave.

"Keep it.  Thanks, Addy."  He moved to get out of the way of the queue behind him.

One of the lounge chairs opened up and Franklin shot for it before it could be occupied again.  He weighed the social stigma of taking a cushioned seat before receiving his drink against the absurdity of paying these prices for coffee and then sitting in a rump-numbing plastic monstrosity for the next two hours.  The comfy chair won and his laptop was out and plugged into the wall in seconds.

He'd lost himself in the ritual of getting on the wireless when a presence in front of him required his attention.  Addy had his coffee in hand and a knowing grin on her face.  Franklin blushed and accepted it, stumbling over his gratitude in a mumble of thanks.

"May I?"

The voice ripped Franklin's concentration into tatters.  There was a woman talking to him, asking him a question.  He popped out his earbuds and looked up at her.

The woman was holding out a plate and staring at him, eyebrows up and neck forward with the question.  The plate had some sort of steaming, crumbly thing on it, with bright purple and deep blue splotches of what he assumed were berries of assorted kinds.  His cognitive processors were locking up trying to figure out why she was offering him this confection and asking him a question at the same time.

It didn't help that she was, as near as he could tell, a rather good looking woman.  And she was talking to *him*.

His confusion and inability to answer became palpable.  She broke the stalemate by waving her other hand, this one with a small cup of something hot enough to warrant a sleeve, at the end table next to him.  He looked and saw that his forgotten coffee was dead center of the small table.  She was asking him to move his coffee to the side so she could put down her plate.

"Of course!  So sorry!"  He slapped down the laptop screen to give himself some maneuvering room and reached for the cup, sliding it to an edge.

"Thank you," said the woman, setting down the plate and drink on the other side of the book-sized tabletop.  She shrugged and a laptop bag strap slid down her arm and into her hand as she sat.  Her lounge chair was the twin of his own, plush and comfortable while ugly and aged, and she looked overdressed and far too pretty to be sitting in it or this venue in general.

Franklin caught himself staring in her direction, though not at her for he was still tied up in his own head, and fought to turn his head back to the now-closed laptop on his knees.

---

Something flashed at the top of Franklin's periphery.  Again.  He looked up in time to catch it full on.  It was the sun, streaming in from the drive-through window, backlighting the barista as she went about preparing drink orders, moving in front of it and out again.

Franklin blinked, his eyes sandpaper.  His hand was in and out of his pocket without thinking, his head already tilting back to receive the eyedrops as he popped the plastic top from the bottle.  He blinked and wiped the back of his hand across the fake tears now sliding down his face.

His knees and lap were uncomfortably warm from the laptop, while his arms and hands were chilled from the cold air that blew across them every time someone walked in or out of the establishment.  If the sun was going down and he'd arrived just after lunch then he'd been sitting there for no less than four hours.  Maybe more.  What time was sunset today?

He stretched and squirmed in the chair, noting the parts of him that were asleep and about to cause him trouble as he tried to stand.  The *save-close-repeat* ritual took less than a minute to clear away the detritus of the productive afternoon and reach a clean desktop before he slept the laptop and returned it to its section of his bag.  The power cable followed into its own pocket, coiled into a shape with which its inner wiring was familiar.

He paused and looked about for anything else he may need to clean up or put away.  The empty coffee cup was easy enough, transferred from the corner of the table to the garbage bin just on the edge of his reach behind him.

He shook his head as he realized that the good-looking woman was gone.  He hadn't noticed when she'd left.

---

Franklin moved to sweep an arm across the desk but thought the better of it.  Some of the cans might not be empty.  Instead, he picked the cans up two and three at a time and dropped them in the bag only after feeling their weight.  One can became the target of any leftover liquid before being carried into the kitchen and emptied into the sink.  He dropped the last can into the bag and hung it on the front door knob to remind him to take it out to the bins.

The pile of dishes in the kitchen taunted him as he saw the stack of cleans at eye level in the cabinet.  The dirty pile was larger.

He realized he was in a bad mood.  Doing the dishes was supposed to be a calming experience.  The warm water, sudsy sponge, and transformative act of producing clean from dirty would have had him smiling on any other day.

But not today.  Why?

---

The virtual world loaded into existence on the large screen.  Textures were applied to the closer objects first, morphing them from bland polygons into armor, weapons, animals, scenery.  The details grew backward into the world, which expanded from a virtual neighborhood to recede into distant mountains, rivers, forests, castles, geology.

All of this happened in seconds, but Franklin was a coder and getting to watch software work was something that always grabbed his attention.  He had logged into the game thousands of times since he'd started playing it, and almost every time he paused to watch it load.

He thought of the huge chunk of his hard drive that made up this game, and the diversity of characters that led to an infinity of textures and shapes, and he marveled at the uncountable number of hours of development that this sort of detail must have taken.  Well, he had no doubt that *someone* was counting, but the number had to be vast.

Tonight, however, he wasn't looking to run dungeons or complete quests that would take him to places that would show off the more manicured parts of the game.  Tonight he was looking to spend time staring at the chat window.  The fact that he was loading up an entire virtual world just to text-chat was not lost on him, but he'd long ago come to a satisfactory justification for that.

```
<Muck> evening all
```

The character in the center of Franklin's screen was covered head to toe in shiny silver armor that reflected everything around it.  Other player characters stood, ran, and flew about, doubled as colorful dots and blurs in his armor.  He found the activity distracting and typed in the key combination to summon his pegasus mount, flying straight up to get away from the crowd.

```
<Shirker> Heya, Muck!
<Feyd> wb
<Majorftw> yo
<Sheeela> wb
```

Franklin opened the window to look at how many of his friends and guild mates were online.  There were a dozen, all of which were marked as inside dungeons, and most seemed to be in the same group.

```
<Muck> what are you all up to?
```

He knew the answer, but the social protocol was required.

```
<Feyd> JL gankfest wanna join?
```

A window appeared over his character asking if he'd like to join Feyd's party and be transported to met up with the rest of them.  He clicked the *Decline* button.

```
<Muck> no thanks. not on for long. having fun?
```

He was desperate for social interaction but not in the mood to run around killing newbie player characters.  That sort of griefing wasn't how he preferred to play his character, and he didn't get the joy out of it that some of his friends did.

```
<Sheeela> It's n00b central with the new release.  Heeere, fishie fishie.
```

Franklin opened the window of daily quests and scanned through it.  Each of them could be completed in five to ten minutes, but even that held no attraction for him.  He began to get more frustrated as his weird mood, smashing at the button to close the window.

```
<Sheeela> 16 17
```

He knew she liked to announce her kill count in guild chat.  Seventeen meant they had been at it for more than an hour, which in turn meant that they would be rowdy and likely drunk.  There was no point in logging into the voice chat as it would be a loud, raucous mess.

```
<Muck> nice. i'm out again. have a good night all.
```

He closed the game and signed into his instant messaging app.  His breath lingered in his chest as he waited for the friends list to highlight who was online.

The gamers he had just left were the only ones to show as online.  His mood rotted, decomposing from mild loneliness to fetid discontent.
