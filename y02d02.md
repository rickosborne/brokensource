Day 2
=====

"Good morning.  My name is Mary Webb and I'm here to withdraw funds from this account, as well as get into my deposit box."

She slid her withdrawal slip across the counter to the woman, who looked all of eighteen no matter how nice her suit, and smiled to recreate the face she knew would show on the computer screen.  The woman smiled back and it looked genuine&mdash;she enjoyed being the access point for rich people and their possessions.

"Of course.  One moment, please."  Her eyes flicked screen to face and back.  "And your passport?"

Xochitl knew this drill, having made this pilgrimage every three months for the last year, and was ready with the little book proffered between them.  The woman, Enid according to her name tag, riffled through it glancing at the pages.  Xochitl knew the action could be explained away as an anti-counterfeiting measure, but intuited Enid was a vicarious voyeur when she saw the flicker of disappointment at the paucity of stamps.  Enid's eyes darted between her screen and the booklet before she closed it and handed it back to Xochitl, looking again at the withdrawal slip.

"For this amount, if you would like it broken into small bills I can have them brought to you with your deposit box?"

"That would be perfect, thanks.  If you look", she held out her hand to point at the withdrawal slip and flipped it palm-side down, "I've written the breakdown on the back."

The woman did and her eyes scanned down the list.  "Of course.  This won't be a problem."

Xochitl set the box on the desk, accepted the envelope of cash from the smiling man, thanked him, and closed and locked the door as he turned to leave.  She unlocked the box and opened the lid, revealing a space that looked empty.  Raising the back end of the box slid its contents forward into view: four thumb drives of varying make and model.

A coat hook on the back of the door accepted her duster.  Pushing the chair under the desk to maximize her space in the small room she stripped out of her sweater and the grey cotton tee beneath.

The pouch between her bra and navel was a black, featureless rectangle across her ribcage.  She inhaled and stretched it away from her stomach to get at the clip that held its strap in place.  The material didn't give much, making the process even trickier.  She knew there was carbon fiber woven into it, or maybe it had something else woven into the carbon fiber.  Either way, the pouch and its strap were light and supple enough that she could wear them all day without noticing anything other than a restriction on deep breathing, and were supposed to be strong enough that a knife couldn't go through them.

The pouch didn't have a zipper, instead opening with a set of overlapping folds and recesses.  A single item was contained within: a fifth thumb drive.  She removed the drive and dropped it into the box before closing and re-locking it.  Her other hand scratched absently at the uncovered patch of torso.  The skin there tingled at the exposure to open air, even though the pouch never itched or made her sweat behind it.

She divided the money from the envelope into three piles.  The small stack of large-denomination bills was secreted into the pouch, resealed, and relashed across her.  She reached for the shirt, but put it back down with a glance at the locked door.  She enjoyed the cooler air on her bared back for the moment.

The second pile of medium denominations went into a wallet she pulled from the inside pocket of the duster.  The wallet was made of a thin, black leather and had a clip that raised as she opened the fold and clamped down when closed.  It didn't hold cards, photos, or anything else&mdash;it only held cash and did so in a discrete, bulge-free form factor.

The third stack, larger than the other two combined yet worth considerably less, went into another wallet in the small black handbag sitting on the desk.  This wallet was more traditional, with a dozen slots for cards, another for a checkbook, the largest accepting the new cash with the bills already present.  A few pre-paid phone cards peeked out, no checkbook or credit cards, alongside a United States driver's license with the name "Webb, Mary" behind clear plastic.

---

The virtual keyboard on her smartphone struggled to keep up with her thumbs.

```
I am in London tonight and maybe a few days.  Anyone got any recommendations for food?
```

She sent the post and flipped off the phone before stowing it in a duster pocket.  Suggestions, if any, would not be offered for several hours.  There were only a dozen people who would see that message, only half of which would feel like they knew her well enough to speak up.

_You said you were in London._

She knew what the inner voice was implying: she'd accessed her bank account and had broadcast her location on the same day.  Anyone trying to connect Xochitl Green with Mary Webb now had one more point of intersection.  The mobile app was _supposed to be_ private, but she was all too familiar with the realities of modern online presence.

_It's been a year.  No one is looking for me._

She swallowed, trying to push down the sudden dryness in her throat.  A year ago yesterday she had last seen anyone she knew in her former life as Xochitl Green.  Is that why she had felt the need to get out?  Had she subconsciously realized the anniversary?

_No one is looking for me._

Like her morning mantra, this was another affirmation always on the tip of her brain.  Not a single day had gone by since Paris when she had not repeated the phrase to herself, sometimes over and over and over.

The man in the line, _queue_, ahead of her stepped forward to the desk, sucking her back out of her head.  Her step across the glossy marble floor was measured to leave a respectable distance between them.  She began pulling items out of her coat: passport, clip-wallet, and phone.  Her thumb reawakened her phone and navigated to display the reservation confirmation before sleeping it again.  She knew the phone could handle an absurd amount of time with the display active, but decades of short-lived phone batteries had buried the habit too deep to overcome.

A blur of motion in her periphery alerted her to the next open check-in attendant.  She navigated the small stack of bag and wheeled suitcase in a wide arc around the man.  The wallet and passport were set on the counter, the phone awakened and pointed at the young man behind it.

"Hi.  I have a reservation for tonight."  Her eyes flicked down to the phone as a hint.

"Good afternoon.  Let me see here."  Alan L, according to his badge, leaned in slightly to look at the confirmation number displayed in big black type, keying it into his computer as his lips parted and pursed with each letter.  "Miss ...," his voice trailed off as he waited for her records to appear.

"Webb," she offered, passport open and at the ready.  She knew the drill.

"Of course."  His frustration at the speed of the computer was apparent in his body language.  No, she saw, it wasn't at the speed of the computer, it was at the perception that his performance was slow because of the speed of the computer.  She decided to let him off the hook, smiling and giving a silent but visible chuckle.

"Slow computer day?"

He exhaled as he spoke, keeping the full extent of his frustration in check.  "It is cumbersome on the best of days, I regret.  I do apologize for the inconvenience."  His return smile was thin but heartfelt.  She waved it away.

"Not a problem.  While it catches up, I had a question."

His posture straightened and smile widened at the opportunity to look at her instead of the screen.  "Certainly."

"My purse was stolen a few days ago, so all of my credit cards are gone until I get back home.  I was able to get plenty of cash," she flipped open the clip wallet to present a not-inconsiderable number of bills, "but I wanted to be sure that wouldn't be a problem?"

Alan frowned and hesitated.

"I mean, it's good I had my passport in my suitcase or I'd have been really out of luck, right?"

Alan's eyes flicked to the female clerk (_clark?_) still helping the other man.  His voice lowered.

"Are you staying only the one night?"

"Well," she paused and lowered her voice to match his conspiring tone, "you tell me.  I'll be in London a few days until I can sort out a flight back home.  I'd like the _option_ of being here for up to a week," her eyebrows raised with the implied query, "but if the credit card thing is going to be a problem then it is what it is, right?"

He made a "hmm" sound and his eyes again darted to each side.

"I'd be willing to put down a cash deposit if necessary."  She thumbed the wallet to show off the highest denomination bills.  "It's not the price that's the problem, it's the plastic."

Alan tipped forward at the waist for a brief moment and looked down at her shoes, then luggage.  She fought off a smirk, but was glad she'd chosen not to go casual today.  She wasn't wearing designer clothes, but the boots and slacks she had on were nice enough.  The luggage was the same: not designer label, but not bargain basement.

His tone was still low.  "If you were to tell me that you preferred to pay for your stay at this time …"  He tilted his head to the side and raised a single eyebrow to match hers.

"You know, Alan," her voice resumed a normal lobby volume as she leaned back to stand up straight, "it occurs to me that I'll just be here for the three nights, and I won't be needing any room service while I'm here, so why don't I just go ahead and pay for it now in case I'm called away suddenly?"

He nodded before turning back to the computer.  "Of course, Miss Webb.  We can accommodate that."  Much typing and several frowns later a printer beneath the counter hummed to life.  Alan placed a sheet of paper and a red felt pen in front of her, marking several boxes with small circles.

Xochitl counted out bills from the wallet to match the balance at the bottom of the paper, handing them across before picking up another pen.  Mary Webb's name was a short one, and she'd had a year of practice, but the signature was more intricate and loopy than Xochitl Green's abstract scrawl.  She lamented the missing "X", as she'd always enjoyed making the cross a stabbing, powerful downstroke.  The upstroke on the "W" just wasn't the same.

The room was an English version of the white box she remembered from dozens of similar suites she had experienced over the past year.  In an odd way she found its closer walls more comforting than the larger and more open layout of the bungalow.  The darker, stained woods and patterns were also a better fit for her mental state than the bright, painted solids of Sicily.

Her eyes were drawn to the desk in the corner and the minimalist stationery set upon it.  She needed to figure out where she was going next.  She couldn't&mdash;

Her phone vibrated in the pocket of her coat on the bed, a thick and muffled buzz.  Perplexed, she held her breath and waited a beat.  It didn't happen again.  It wasn't a call, and the pattern was wrong for a text message.  This was a relief, as no one should have that number.

One of the apps?

The tiny notification light blinked at her as she pulled the device out of the pocket.  A message displayed as she activated the screen.

```
1 new private message from muckingabout
```

It hadn't come via text message but by the social app she had posted to earlier.  She hadn't expected anyone to respond, or at most had expected links to restaurant websites.  Why was `muckingabout` sending her a private message?

She tapped the notice to launch the app.  It navigated to show her post and the reply below it.

```
orenda> I am in London tonight and maybe a few days.  Anyone got any recommendations for food?
(friends, 20 minutes ago)

muckingabout> I'm living in London these days.  Want to meet up for dinner tonight or tomorrow?
(private, 2 minutes ago)
```

The phone vibrated in her hand and a third message appeared beneath the others.

```
callmetim> Never been, sorry!  I'm supposed to go for a con next summer, so let me/us know what you find!
(just now)
```

Annoyed at the distraction, Xochitl stared at the private message and tried to think about what she knew about `muckingabout`.

She _didn't_ know his name, but she was almost certain he was male.  Sex and gender weren't hot topics of conversation in her circles, but there were a few people she was pretty sure were female.  His avatar was a hazy sunrise, so no help there.  She associated him with systems coding and kernel hackery, but could't come up with anything personal.  She tapped his name to see his profile.

Oh, it was right there: Franklin H.  The address for his website, `franklincod.es` didn't tell her much more.  Tapping the link launched the Web browser and loaded the page.  A blog with a generic layout and template flowed down the screen.

The blog posts confirmed what Xochitl remembered, focusing on low-level coding gotchas, optimizations, interface investigations, and minutia that only a hardcore bit-twiddler could appreciate.  The archive listing on the side of the page showed dozens of entries going back more than five years.  None of the posts on the landing page had any personal details, but she'd have time to dig later.

She flipped the phone back to the messaging app and bit her lip as she typed in a private reply.

```
orenda> I could go for that.  Travel makes me hungry though, so it'll be Dutch.  I'm craving a steak/burger/etc.  What do you have in mind?
```

Her thumb hovered over the green _Send_ button as she held her breath.

_Are you sure about this?_

Releasing her lip and shifting her bite, her molars gnashed together between her jaws.

_Yes.  Yes I am.  I haven't **talked** to anyone in a year._

She inhaled through her nose and made a ginger tap at the button.  An animation moved the text from where she was typing it up to meet with the rest.

Xochitl wouldn't have chosen this particular restaurant.  I was a little too private, a little too dark, and a little too much like a first-date place.  She hadn't gotten a first-date vibe from Franklin's messages, but she didn't like the direction this could take.

She looked around the dining room.  The cloth was black linen.  The candles on the tables were real, not electric.  The steak knives were serious business, and were the prominent utensil.  There were actual, living plants secreted in alcoves and other places too small to fit tables, breaking the sight lines between couples.

The menu, however, had reasonable pricing.  Not eat-here-every-night pricing, but nothing a white collar would have to save up for.  She had asked for steak, and steak was the dominant menu item.

"May I help you find your party?"  The hostess approaching looked like she could stand to eat a few more steaks, desserts, and maybe a stick or two of butter.  The black dress and red sash complemented the decor, but made her look like she would blow away in a storm.

"I'm looking for Franklin."  Xochitl's eyes squeezed shut as she realized that she didn't know his last name.  She fought back a frown and sold it like it should have been enough to go on.

It must have been, as the girl gave a slight nod and tilted her head.  "Of course.  Right this way."

Franklin was hidden behind a thick mass of vines and heart-shaped leaves.  Elbow on the table and chin in hand, his other hand thumbed across the screen of a cell (_mobile_) phone.  He didn't see them approach.  The hostess peeled off without a flourish, leaving Xochitl standing at the end of the table.

"Uhhm," her attempt at clearing her throat failed and came out sounding more like a pneumatic rattle, "Franklin?"

His shoulders jumped inside his sport coat and his eyes widened behind their glasses.  The mobile was flipped face-down on the far corner of the table as he stood to greet her.

"Oh!  Hello!  You made it!"

She reached a hand out to him and faltered.

_He only knows "orenda".  Am I going to be Mary or Xochitl?_

He took her hand, but the silence was awkward and on her shoulders.

_You have to be Mary.  Xochitl is dead.  You're not her any more._

"Mary."  She smiled and he returned it.

_In my head, I'm still Xochitl.  It's Mary who doesn't exist._

He motioned fed her to sit, casual but refusing to be anything but a proper gentleman.  He smirked as he spoke.  "Names are difficult, right?"

Her eyebrows arched, but she was still too tied up in her head to string together coherent words.

"You know ```muckingabout```.  I know ```orenda```."  His hands pulled and pushed from his chest to her own.  "But we spend so much time making sure we don't", a palm-forward stopping motion and bug eyes underlined his point, "ever, ever use our real names online.  I was so anxious trying to figure out how to introduce myself."

"Yeah.  Exactly."  Xochitl's entire body relaxed and her elbows found the tabletop.  "Cognitive dissonance.  I can't tell you the last time I said my name out loud to someone who wasn't behind a counter."

His cocked head alerted her to what she had said.

"Yeah," the syllable drew out in confessional embarrassment, "I don't have too many real-world friends these days."

The wide grin was conspiratorial.  He pointed a finger at his face and made a circling motion.  "Virtual office worker.  I get it.  I've got a few mates left," he winked at her, "but mostly because drinking alone is awful."

"Ah.  That's how I got there."  She nodded, acknowledging.  "I don't drink, so I didn't need to keep anyone around."

His eyes lingered on the tall glass of dark, foamy liquid between them.  He pointed at it and asked, "Is this okay?"

"What?  Oh!  Yeah, sorry.  It's a personal choice, nothing else."

His grin had disappeared and his hands had stopped moving between them.  "I have a friend who is recovering."

The pause was again on Xochitl.  "Well, that got serious fast.  Sorry about that."  She inhaled to continue, but a server appeared and took her drink order: sparkling water.

Franklin gestured at the menu in front of her as the server walked away.  "You said you wanted steak, right?  Anything in particular?"

Xochitl saw that it was the same menu she had seen posted beside the front door.  She didn't bother to pick it up to look at it.  "The filet."

"I'm more of a porterhouse man, myself.  Each to their own.  Need this?"  His hand again flicked at her menu as he picked up his own.  "Do you need this?"

She picked up a corner and pushed it toward him.  "Nope.  All yours."

"I have a confession."  He stacked the menus on the corner of the table and pushed the unused wine glasses in the same direction.  "I spent an hour Googling you today."

Xochitl leaned back a hair and looked at him.  He was casual, not ironic.  When he said _confession_ he meant it&mdash;he felt guilty about it and needed to tell her before it slipped out some other way.  It was a sentence that could have set of klaxons and flashing lights, but his demeanor was genuine.  She was intrigued to see where he was going with this.

"Oh really?  And what did you find?"

His fingers and thumbs pinched together and stretched an imaginary line between them.

"Nothing."  He shrugged.  "The meaning of _orenda_, but nothing about you."

Her smirk was mischievous and secretive.  "Well, good.  I try very hard to keep my identities from overlapping."  She sipped at her water.  "I sense a _but_ coming on."

"But."  His hands drew back and came together, one covering the other in contemplation.  "I did go back through your posts for the last six months."  He pointed at his mobile, still on the corner of the table.

"And?"

The waiter appeared again to take their orders and she had to repeat herself.

"And?"

He seemed to have rethought his strategy and held up a finger.  "Let me ask you," the finger swiveled to point at himself and he made the circling motion again, "what do I do for a living?"

"Open Source systems and driver hacker.  I presume for company that makes its money supporting free software.  But I don't think you ever mention them by name."

"Which you got from ...?"  He let the question hang there, even though they both knew the answer.

"Your blog," she threw a nod at his phone, "and your posts."

"Right.  But I wasn't able to find your blog."  The question was implied this time, but hung there just the same.

She shrugged, deflecting.  "I don't have one these days.  I used to, just not anymore."

He seemed both satisfied and a little deflated at this.  He was vindicated that nothing existed for him to find, but also sad at the exact same fact.

"But you're good.  That's obvious."

"How do you mean?"  She was fishing, but didn't care.  She still couldn't tell where he was going with this.

"You are able to hold your own on that," he gestured at the mobile again, "which is no mean feat.  You talk about low-level network code, crypto, and a dozen other topics.  You talk," his hands splayed out and he paused to emphasize the point, "like an Open Source hacker."

She waited for him to continue, but he made it clear it was her turn to explain.  She continued to play coy and casual.

"I was, in a previous life.  I went private a while back."  She expected him to be scandalized or disappointed but neither came through.  "Part of that was making a clear demarc", she gave a micro-pause to ensure he got the word, "between my old life and my new one."

He was intrigued and showed it.  "If you told me your last name, would I know it?"  He muttered "Mary" several times as he reached for his beer, trying to evoke the last names of Marys he had heard of.  His eyes lost focus and pulled up to the corners of the room.

She had to laugh at this.  "Webb.  Double-b.  Mary Webb.  And no, you wouldn't."  She sipped her own water and let the conversation slow down.  "Demarc," she finished, with a slow chopping motion of her free hand.
