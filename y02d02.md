Year 2, Day 2
=============

"Good morning.  My name is Mary Webb and I'm here to withdraw funds from this account, as well as get into my deposit box."

She slid her withdrawal slip across the counter to the woman, who looked all of eighteen no matter how nice her suit, and smiled to recreate the face she knew would show on the computer screen.  The woman smiled back and it looked genuine--she enjoyed being the access point for rich people and their possessions.

"Of course.  One moment, please."  Her eyes flicked screen to face and back.  "And your passport?"

Xochitl knew this drill, having made this pilgrimage every three months for the last year, and was ready with the little book proffered between them.  The woman, Enid according to her name tag, riffled through it glancing at the pages.  Xochitl knew the action could be explained away as an anti-counterfeiting measure, but knew Enid was a vicarious voyeur when she saw the flicker of disappointment at the paucity of stamps.  Enid's eyes darted between her screen and the booklet before she closed it and handed it back to Xochitl, looking again at the withdrawal slip.

"For this amount, if you would like it broken into small bills I can have them brought to you with your deposit box?"

"That would be perfect, thanks.  If you look", she held out her hand to point at the withdrawal slip and flipped it palm-side down, "I've written the breakdown on the back."

The woman did and her eyes scanned down the list.  "Of course.  This won't be a problem."

Xochitl set the box on the desk, accepted the envelope of cash from the smiling man, thanked him, and closed and locked the door as he turned to leave.  She unlocked the box and opened the lid, revealing a space that looked empty.  Raising the back end of the box slid its contents forward into view: four thumb drives of varying make and model.

A coat hook on the back of the door accepted her duster.  Pushing the chair under the desk to maximize her space in the small room she stripped out of her sweater and the grey cotton tee beneath.

The pouch between her bra and navel was a black, featureless rectangle across her ribcage.  She inhaled and stretched the rectangle away from her stomach to get at the clip that held the strap in place.  The material didn't give much, making the process even trickier.  She knew there was carbon fiber woven into it, or maybe it had something else woven into the carbon fiber.  Either way, the pouch and its strap were light and supple enough that she could wear them all day without noticing anything other than a restriction on deep breathing, and were supposed to be strong enough that a knife couldn't go through them.

The pouch didn't have a zipper, instead opening with a set of overlapping folds and recesses.  A single item was contained within: a fifth thumb drive.  She removed the drive and dropped it into the box before closing and re-locking it.  Her other hand scratched absently at the uncovered patch of torso.  The skin there tingled at the exposure to open air, even though the pouch never itched or made her sweat behind it.

She divided the money from the envelope into three piles.  The small stack of large-denomination bills was secreted into the pouch, resealed, and relashed across her.  She reached for the shirt, but put it back down with a glance at the locked door.  She enjoyed the cooler air on her bared back for the moment.

The second pile of medium denominations went into a wallet she pulled from the inside pocket of the duster.  The wallet was made of a thin, black leather and had a clip that raised as she opened the fold and clamped down when closed.  It didn't hold cards, photos, or anything else--it only held cash and did so in a discrete, bulge-free form factor.

The third stack, larger than the other two combined yet worth considerably less, went into another wallet in the small black handbag sitting on the desk.  This wallet was more traditional, with a dozen slots for cards, another for a checkbook, the largest accepting the new cash with the bills already present.  A few pre-paid phone cards peeked out, no checkbook or credit cards, alongside a United States driver's license with the name "Webb, Mary" behind clear plastic.
