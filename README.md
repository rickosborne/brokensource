_Broken Source_
===============

This repo contains the National Novel Writing Month 2012 (NaNoWriMo) project for Rick Osborne, a brief work of fiction entitled _Broken Source_.  It is an original work and is copyright (c) 2012 by Rick Osborne with all rights reserved.

I am putting this on GitHub as a way to keep myself honest about my progress.  This project is _not_ Open Source.  There is no license because the content is mine alone.

If you find you enjoy it, you may be interested in the first in the series, _Trust Network_, available for free download or non-profit print-on-demand from lulu.com:

_Trust Network_ was started in 2005 and shows its (pre-smartphone!) age toward the beginning.  It also shows my novice writing skills through the first third of the book, though I am still quite proud of the last two-thirds that were completed in 2006 and 2007.

Thank you.
