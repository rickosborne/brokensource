Day 3
=====

Xochitl stared at the ceiling above her bed, fingers crossed on her stomach and tapping out an absent rhythm.

_So that didn't suck.  It started off a little rocky, but he was nice._

_Second date material?_

Her fingers stopped of their own accord, hanging in space.

_Was that a first date?_

Her eyes closed, the lids tight against each other.

_The man Googled you.  That was a first date._

Air hissed through her teeth.

_Frak._

Her phone vanished from the nightstand, appearing in her hand with the screen already on and her finger hammering down into the app icon.

---

The screen was a bright white abyss, illuminating the bathroom with reflected light.  It dimmed by half, causing Xochitl to frown.  She slid a fingertip in a small circle to wake the device and bring it back to full brightness.

_Five minutes.  You've been sitting here for five minutes._

She stood up and flushed, then leaned back against the marble countertop and continued to stare at the screen.

_Write ***something***._

```
orenda> Thanks for
```

_Wait._

```
orenda> I enjoyed dinner last night, thanks.
```

_You need more than that._

```
orenda> I enjoyed dinner last night, thanks.  I'm in town for two more days.  Want to do it again?
```

_Too many words._

Her fingertip bounced on the virtual backspace key.

```
orenda> I enjoyed dinner last night, thanks.  What's for dinner tonight?
```

_Whoa.  That's ... aggressive._

Her front teeth tapped and slid against each other as he jaw worked.  The words were her first spoken of the morning, and were rough from her throat.

"Screw it."

The green ```Send``` button flashed blue as she jabbed it with a knuckle.

"I feel underdressed," Franklin said as they sat down.

Xochitl was flattered, feeling vindicated in her choice of wardrobe.  "You look fine," she drew out the syllable to emphasize that she meant it, "but I had a friend who called me out for not playing dress-up often enough.  And you can only fit so many outfits into a suitcase, so ...", she shrugged with a nonchalance that she didn't mean, "so why not pack one or two nice outfits?"

Her shrug lengthened into a maneuver to free herself from the bolero  jacket that covered her top.
