Xochitl navigated her way through the dining room toward the back wall.  It was mid-afternoon and most of the tables were empty but her old predilection for booths held fast.

"Mary," Franklin's voice came from behind her, "hey."

She turned and smiled, waving the jacket over one arm in the direction she'd been heading.  "Good timing.  I was just about to sit.  Is a booth okay?"  Her urge was to keep walking toward one without waiting for an answer, but she held her ground.

"Yes, fine."  His reply was immediate, though she did see his eyes flit around the room for a moment.

He seemed nervous about something.

"Are you okay?"

He smiled at her and she could see some of his tension thaw and melt away.

"Yes, I'm just being silly.  I shouldn't be this agitated."

Xochitl did her best to make her own smile comforting.  She was inexperienced with dating and small talk and empathized with his state.  She could think of only one solution.

"Let's get some food in us.  It'll help."

She looked across the room and made eye contact with a server who was helping another table.  The young woman nodded and smiled in acknowledgement as she continued to move plates of food from the tray at her hip to the people who had ordered it.

"I'm glad you suggested this place," she said, looking at the decor, "I've seen it the past few times I was in London."

"It's a bit too healthy for me, to be honest."

She lost her smile and turned to face him.  "Oh really?  Did you want to try someplace else?"

"No."  He paused, organizing his thoughts. "It's&mdash;"

The waitress appeared and Franklin fumbled back to silence.

"Good afternoon.  I am Himani."  The hand not holding the small serving tray to her side made a wave to indicate an engraved name tag.  "May I get you something to drink?"

From the black hair and mocha skin, Xochil had expected an Indian accent, but Himani sounded like any other Londoner.

"Heya, Himani.  Do you have iced tea?"

The server's eyes may have widened the tiniest amount in surprise.  "Unfortunately, no.  But may I offer you a hot tea and a glass of ice?"

"That will work."  Xochitl had expected as much.  The temperature outside was cold and rainy enough to require both a sweater and a raincoat.  Only Americans would be crazy enough to want a cold drink on a day like this.  But it never hurt to ask.

"Green or black tea?"

"Black is fine, thanks."

"And for you?"  She turned to face Franklin.

"I'll take a hot tea, black."

"Of course.  I will be right back with those drinks and your menus."

She made a brisk line for the kitchen door as Xochitl and Franklin turned back to each other.

"You were saying?"

Franklin clasped his hands together and shrunk into his shoulders, as if bracing himself against an icy wind.

"I've invited my girlfriend to eat with us.  Is that okay?"

Xochitl's brain got stuck on the "my girlfriend" part and refused to process the rest of the words.  She didn't respond fast enough for Franklin, who stammered to fill in the silence.

"If it's not alright then I can call her and …"  He groped around for explanation but couldn't figure out how to form it into linear narrative.  "It's just that I've never introduced her to my online friends before."

He trailed off, but she had processed and was back up to conversational speed.

"I don't think you ever mentioned a girlfriend in any of your posts?"  She meant it as a statement but it came out as a question.

"We only started dating a few weeks ago.  None of my mates at work know yet, because, well, you know how it is.  They aren't that kind of crowd.  And she doesn't want&mdash;Oh!"

Franklin did a sliding jump between the bench and table that left Xochitl again stunned.  He almost sprinted across the dining room toward someone who had just entered.  They were backlit against the windows, so Xochitl couldn't make out much more than matching heights.

Xochitl wrapped herself around the realization that less than a minute ago she'd thought she was on a date, while now she was about to meet the woman who was her competition.

Competition?

She barely knew Franklin.  Yes, she had spent hours getting herself to a point where she was okay with the idea of seeing someone.  But at least she wasn't too invested yet, right?

The couple arrived at the booth, Franklin moving aside to let his girlfriend sit first.

Xochitl got a good look at the woman for the first time and let out a strangled gasp.  The sound of her surprise was muffled by the thumps and swishes of the couple sitting and sliding along the bench.

"Mary, this is Camila.  Camila, Mary."

Xochitl saw the woman across from her, eyes as wide as she imagined her own to be, give a slight shake of her head before extending a hand not in a shake but a quick wave.

"Hi," the woman said.  The smile that accompanied it was lopsided, showing off straight, gleaming white, predatory teeth.

Xochitl didn't recover as fast.  "Camila?"

When the woman said her name it had a sharper middle syllable, even though the voice was modulated as warm and salutatory.  "Yes, Camila."  The paired nod would have been received as a confirmation by anyone else, but Xochitl knew its intent was to underline the point.

"Very nice to meet you."

Xochitl had no idea what to do.  She needed to think, but her thoughts were doing sprints across her brain.

"Would you two excuse me for a moment?"  She showed her palms to them, "I need to wash my hands."

Franklin nodded and moved to say something, but the woman spoke up.

"Excellent idea.  Do you mind if I join you?"

Xochitl's stomach acid was in full panic mode, causing her abdomen to flutter as she walked into the restroom behind the other woman.  It was a small affair with only two stalls and a sink.  The woman shot straight for the far stall but didn't enter.  Instead, she poked her head around the corner to verify that the compartment was empty.  She turned on her heel and launched herself at Xochitl, lioness teeth bared and canines glinting.

---

Xochitl stiffened and closed her eyes, not knowing what else to do.  The woman wrapped her arms around Xochitl, pinning and squeezing with surprising force for a woman of her size.

"Xochitl!"

Xochitl couldn't categorize the emotions that were ransacking her mental state.  She teared up as soon as she realized that the woman was hugging her, not knocking her to the floor.  Her breath stuck in her throat and she knew if she didn't take it slow she'd end up crying.

She moved to free enough of her arms to hug back.  The two woman stood there, neither wanting to break the embrace.  Xochitl exhaled a slow breath and spoke first in a low whisper.

"Candice.  What are you doing here?"

The woman's body stiffened the moment her name was spoken and she stepped back away from Xochitl.  Xochitl could see that, like herself, she had glistening eyes that had stopped before streaming tears.

"We cannot talk abut this now.  Later."

Her hands, still conjuring visions of claws in Xochitl's memory, moved to grab tissues from the dispenser.

"Where are you staying?"

---

Xochitl knew who was on the other side of the door, but she couldn't stop herself from looking through the peephole.  She hesitated, but thought she saw the corners of a fisheye-warped smile.  Her reluctance thawed in the memory of the flying leap of a hug that afternoon.  She drew back the chain and opened the door, stepping almost behind it to let the other woman enter.  The door was closed and rechained before either woman looked at the other.

They embraced again without knowing who moved first.  Xochitl was sobbing within seconds, with the running nose, flushed neck, and slobbering drool of a full-on waterworks display.  She felt the other woman return the hug and support her as she shuddered and leaned into it.  A hand brushed her hair from her face, then from the back of her head to her back, eliciting an even tighter squeeze.

She felt herself being walked to the edge of the bed, where they sat for several minutes.  When it looked like Xochitl could sit up on her own, the other woman snuck away to the bathroom to return with a box of tissues.

"I'm sorry," Xochitl said between sniffles.  "I don't know what this is."  She made a circling motion with her hand, pointing at her head and neck.

The woman continued to stroke Xochitl's hair, plucking used tissues from between Xochitl's fingers and replacing them with fresh ones.

"I do."  She spoke with a gentleness that Xochitl had only heard once before.  It was both foreign and natural at the same time.  "Have you been alone the whole time?"

The question was asked with care, but it hit Xochitl like a physical blow.  The answer was obvious, and it made Xochitl return to back-spasming sobs that took a dozen more tissues to subside.

"I had thought you would go back home."  The statement was a pleading whisper that almost came out as a question.

"I&mdash;  I&mdash;  I didn't think I could.  I didn't think it was safe.  I didn't know if the passport would …"  She waved her hands in front of her, helpless before the infinity of possibilities that ended with an unnameable Bad Thing.  "Everyone was just … gone.  You.  Monique.  Gil.  Everyone."

She collected herself, sitting up straight and pulling in several deep breaths.

"I had the money, but I couldn't figure out what to do with it."  She looked into the other woman's eyes and a lopsided grin came to her.  "You should have seen the first time I had to go back to the bank for more money."  She laughed, which stopped up her nose again.  "I thought everyone in the place was staring at me."

The other woman grinned, but the only thing to reach her eyes was pain.

"Stupid, I know."  She rolled her eyes at the memory.  "And now I'm hysterical and bawling about it."  She hung her head.  "It's just been so long.  Franklin's the first person I've really spoken to since last year.  I don't know how you do it."

The woman reached out and put her hand on Xochitl's arm.  "I do not.  I do not think I could do that, either."

Xochitl knitted her eyebrows.  "Really?  What do you do?"

The woman's smile was sardonic.  "Work.  There is always work."

"Sure," Xochitl smirked, "but I don't know how you do that, either.  Just a week of your work took a decade or two off of my life."

The woman shrugged, non-committal.

"I mean, the names alone … how do you get used to a different alias every month?"

"I&mdash;"

"Waitasec!"  Xochitl shrugged away from the woman, sliding a bit down the length of the bed.  "I never did get a straight answer.  Is Candice your real name?  Or is it Camila?"

The woman kept up the gentle attitude, and let Xochitl keep her space, but there was a wall there that Xochitl wasn't going to get through.

"For now it is Camila.  It would be better if you think of me that way."

Xochitl squinted at her, as much as her puffy eyes would allow.

"So I don't trip up and call you Candice in front of someone?"

Candice-Camila gave a slight twitch of her head that was an acknowledgment without accusation.  Xochitl's mind whirled.

"Hey, is Franklin&mdash;  Is he a *job*?"  The last word came out with a disgusted effort.

Xochitl could see the conflict raging behind Candice-Camila's eyes.  The woman tried to keep it in check but failed.  Her body language was uncomfortable, and her motion degraded to sharp movements.  Xochitl saw something else that she recognized, but she couldn't place it.
