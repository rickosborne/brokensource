Franklin, Day 2
===============

There wasn't enough caffeine in the world for this job, not even if you rounded up every barista and extracted the osmotically-absorbed caffeine from their living skin.

Franklin stared at the little green dot above his screen.  The little green dot sat next to an almost-invisible camera that was actively recording and transmitting his image.  The image was compressed via a thorough comparison with the image from a fraction of a second ago, the image before that, and so on.  The compressed data was pitched, in stuttering fits and starts, to locations around the globe to have the process reversed.

Franklin didn't care about any of this, but his hands were front and center of that image, cupped as if pleading in prayer.

"Just listen for a second.  Please."  The last word was drawn out, begging, and was accompanied with closed eyes and a slow exhalation.  It wasn't a whine.  It was the sound of someone who has explained something far too many times.

Around the edges of Franklin's screen were a dozen faces, each being streamed from a computer or device owned by one of the people who were right now testing his patience.  To be fair, not all of them were annoying him.  Only some of the other participants were arguing.  But the others weren't helping, so they weren't on his good side, either.

For one blissful second, Franklin had everyone's quiet attention.

"To clarify," the words came slow and calm, "we've got some people for the patch and some against."

One of the others, a man with a frown deep enough to be visible beneath a thick and almost comical mustache, moved to speak.  Franklin continued, cutting him off before he could start.

"The reasons for and against", his palms split and descended to underscore his words, "*are not* important right now.  The fact that we've got this kind of split is enough to warrant turfing the discussion for now."

Again, several people signaled their intent to speak.  Franklin silenced them by grabbing a cardboard box from his desk, reaching inside it, and waving its contents at the green dot.

"I've got the pumpkin."  The stuffed squash was just oversized enough and overstuffed enough to make it difficult to grab with one hand, even for Franklin's long fingers.  He threw the empty box toward the kitchen and gripped the toy with both hands.  "Regardless of how I feel about the patch, I won't merge something that's going to cause this much division."

He paused to see if anyone would argue, but most of the pairs of eyes bounced to follow the orange blob on the center of their screens.

"It's turfed.  For now.  We'll revisit it next week when we've all," he stared at the green dot, willing himself to command their attention, "had a chance to think on it."

He paused one last time, but it was clear that everyone knew what was coming and welcomed it as he did.

"Have a good day, all, and see you next week."

He didn't wait again, going straight for the red button to end the video conference.  Notifications started rolling down the corner of his screen, as several of the conference members started sending him instant messages.  He debated closing out of that, too, but decided against it.  It would look like he was running away from his responsibility.  This way, the malcontents could wait for him to reply on his on time.

Franklin leaned back in his chair and tossed the pumpkin from hand to hand.  The crocheted pattern held his rapt attention.  He'd been told the story, and knew that it was one of a kind.  It had been created over the course of a month of meetings like that one, back when they were voice-only affairs.  It had been given from one team member to another as a joke, but it stuck as a mascot.

Franklin was now the King of the Patch Pumpkin, also known as the Patch King.  The toy pumpkin had become the physical representation of the power to be the absolute monarch over their software kingdom.  The ruler, being somewhere between elected and sentenced, had the final authority to accept or reject changes to the source code to which they all contributed.

No project this large would ever survive by committee, but no Open Source contributors would ever stand for an autocratic dictator, so the Patch King was born.  The pumpkin moved around the group as needed, sometimes in custody for months and sometimes for as little as a few weeks.

It and its box had just arrived on Franklin's doorstep that morning.

In retrospect, he knew it was one of the reasons for his mood the night before.  He wasn't looking forward to being Patch King.  He'd been nominated because he was, for now, the Switzerland of their group.  Causes came and went, with each member championing their own here and there, and the group had always been smart enough to make sure the Patch King was neutral on any upcoming big projects.

This meant that Franklin's primary jobs, for as long as he had the pumpkin, were to clean up messy code and to keep strong-willed, independent coders from bickering.

There wasn't enough caffeine in the world for this job.

Franklin took his cup from the barista, careful to grab only the sleeve and bottom rim.  He turned to scan the room.

She was here again.  The woman from yesterday.  She had the same tight ponytail and a similar, but different, almost-too-nice suit.

The cafe was less occupied today at only half capacity.  Franklin chose a lounge chair that left an empty between himself and the woman.  After the usual juggle involving his bag, coffee, and laptop he had an idea.  He pulled the power cable from his bag and leaned across the empty chair.

"Do you mind?"  He held out a hand with the plug.

The woman stirred, reached past her cheek to tuck her long, straight hair behind an ear, and removed an earbud.

"Pardon?"  She looked straight into his eyes before noticing the cord.  "Oh, of course."

Franklin swallowed as she reached to one side to plug the socket into the wall.  He had no idea what her accent was, but it was amazing.
