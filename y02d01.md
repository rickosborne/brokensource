Year 2, Day 1
=============

She rolled over on the bed, leg landing in a patch of sunlight that made her skin tingle.  Her fingernails scratched at the itch, then again as it didn't go away.  She swatted at the increasing sensation of pressure.  Her teeth ground together at the annoyance, lips parting in a sneer.

Xochitl Green's eyelids stretched and went wide, snapping apart with force.

"Agh!"

She could feel her skin burning in the Mediterranean sunlight, knowing that another 5 minutes in this position would leave her with a pink mark.  Had she slept through more than 15 minutes she'd have a burn.  Most of her would take longer to cook, but the thin skin on the back of her knee wasn't used to such abuse.

She rolled onto her back, pulling her leg out of the slice of light.  Her eyes rolled to the corners of her periphery, as if calibrating themselves for another day of use.

_That's it.  I'm done.  I need to get someplace less … antagonistic._

Her nostrils flared to accommodate a large inhalation of unwelcome morning air.  Her jaw ached.  She had been grinding her teeth in her sleep again.

_You are the only person on the planet who would be unhappy living in a bungalow in Sicily.  You know that, right?_

On cue, a breeze parted the opaque curtains in the windows around the room, blinding her.  She exhaled through her teeth.

_Yeah.  I know.  If it weren't for all that pesky sunlight this place would be perfect._

"Get up."  Her voice caught in her dry throat, producing something more like a cough than English.

_Please._

_Please get up._

_You.  I.  I can't do another day in bed._

She swallowed and licked her lips, though her dry tongue didn't help much.

"Fine.  'mup."

She raised a leg into the air and let it come down to one side, leveraging herself into a tumble that landed one foot on the floor and her arms beneath her to push herself off of the mattress.  She saw starbursts and wobbled.  Her arms shot out to her sides in warding, then palms to eye sockets until the throbbing stopped.

_Food._

She felt the breeze on her bare legs a second after the sunlight invaded along the edges of her palms.  Keeping her eyes covered she turned, mentally oriented herself to miss the end of her bed, and walked across the room.  Her elbow slid along the doorway as she passed into the main room.  Only some of the curtains in here were drawn--the wind slapping them around all night would keep her awake--so even more light wedged its way past her hands.

Eyes squeezed tight, one hand groped for the kitchen counter and felt its way along for the fruit bowl.  A single apple remained.  Her memory of it from the night before showed it as flawed and imperfect, backed up by the spots that were soft to the touch.  She knew she wouldn't be able to take a bite if she actually looked at it, but she also knew that it was still an acceptable calorie source.

Keeping her eyes closed, she chomped off a too-large chunk of the fruit, feeling her teeth slide through the softer crust before sinking into the crisper mantle.  It tasted fine, causing her mental model to repair itself to something closer to a Platonic Ideal Apple.

She chewed, swallowed, bit, repeated, listening to the world beyond her walls.  Wind.  Surf.  Cars.  The garbled syllables of people talking some distance away.  Her brain teased apart the sounds, buffering her sensory system, and her eyelids parted of their own accord no longer afraid of the impending overload.
